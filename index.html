</center>

<br>

<b>The flux of cosmic rays (CR)</b> in the heliosphere is subjected to remarkable time variations caused by the 11-year cycle of solar activity. <br>
To study this effect, we have developed a web application (<b>Heliophysics Virtual Observatory</b>) that collects real-time data on solar activity, interplanetary plasma, and charged radiation from several space missions and observatories.<br>
 As we will show, our application can be used to <b>visualize</b>, <b>manipulate</b>, and <b>download</b> updated data on sunspots, heliospheric magnetic fields, solar wind, and neutron monitors counting rates.<br>
 A nowcasting for the energy spectra of CRs near Earth is also provided, using calculations and real-time neutron monitor data as input.<br>
<b>Data are daily updated from databases listed in the Resources section.</b><br>
